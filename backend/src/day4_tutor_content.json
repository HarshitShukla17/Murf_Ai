For example, you might store a user's name in a variable called 'username' or store a number in a variable called 'age'. Variables make your code reusable and flexible because you can change the value without rewriting your entire program.",

There are two main types: 'for loops' which repeat a specific number of times, and 'while loops' which repeat as long as a condition is true. For example, if you want to print numbers 1 to 10, you'd use a for loop instead of writing 10 separate print statements.",

A function can take inputs (called parameters), process them, and return an output. For example, you might create a function called 'calculate_area' that takes length and width as inputs and returns the area of a rectangle.",

For example, if a user's age is over 18, show adult content, else show kid-friendly content. Conditionals make your programs dynamic and responsive to different situations.",

For example, instead of having 'student1', 'student2', 'student3', you can have a single 'students' list containing all names.

Understanding data types is important because different operations work with different types. For example, you can add numbers together, but adding a number to text might cause an error or unexpected behavior.",

Each recursive call works on a smaller piece until reaching a base case that stops the recursion. A classic example is calculating factorial: factorial of 5 is 5 times factorial of 4, which is 4 times factorial of 3, and so on, until you reach factorial of 1 which is just 1.",

Using try-catch blocks (or try-except in Python), you can catch errors and handle them gracefully instead of letting your program crash. For example, if a user enters text when you expect a number, you can catch that error and ask them to try again instead of the program crashing.",
